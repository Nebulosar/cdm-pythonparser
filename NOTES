Notes on builds via travis

This sequence of steps worked for me:
- make sure your checkout is in sync with the master branch
- make sure you have .travis.yml file
- run 'travis setup releases --force'; it will:
  - create a key in the repository
  - update .travis.yml with a new encoded key
  - make some changes in .travis.yml which you may not want to have
  -- the 'upload file' question is left without an answer
  -- I usually keep a copy of the original .travis.yml and take the only new key from the re-written one
- make changes in the ChangeLog file
- do 'git add ...'
- do 'git commit ...'
- do 'git tag vX.X.X'
  -- v in front is important and the pattern should be followed precisely
- do 'git push --tags'
  -- at this moment travis notices the commit with a tag and will start bulding and deploying;
     it is vitally important to have a tag together with a commit
